# Two Sum Problem - LeetCode

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

### Constraints
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
- Only one valid answer exists.

## Solution Approaches

### 1. Brute Force Approach
This approach checks every possible pair of numbers in the array.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int arr[] = new int[2];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    arr[0] = i;
                    arr[1] = j;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return arr;
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n²) - For each element, we search through the rest of the array.
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - Only storing a fixed-size array.

### 2. Optimized Approach Using HashMap
This approach uses a HashMap to store each number and its index. For each element, we check if its complement (target - current number) exists in the HashMap.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>(); // num -> index
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i]; // What we need to find
            
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { map.get(complement), i }; // Found the pair
            }
            
            map.put(nums[i], i); // Store the num and its index
        }
        
        // As per constraint, there's always one solution
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("No solution found");
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n) - We only need to iterate through the array once.
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - In the worst case, we might need to store all elements in the HashMap.

### How HashMap Works Internally in Java

#### Step 1: Core Terminology

| Term | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| Bucket | HashMap stores data in buckets. Each bucket is a slot in an internal array where multiple items can be stored. |
| Initial Capacity | By default, Java HashMap creates an internal array of 16 buckets. |
| Load Factor | Default value is 0.75. When 75% of the buckets are filled, HashMap doubles its capacity (rehashing happens). |
| Key → hashCode → index | HashMap first computes hashCode() of the key, then compresses it into an array index using (hash & (capacity - 1)). |

#### Step 2: Hashing & Index Calculation

The precise formula in Java for calculating index:
```java
index = (hash & (capacity - 1))
```

For capacity = 16, index is (hash & 15).

This is equivalent to hash % capacity, but faster because it uses bitwise AND (faster than modulo %).

Process flow:
Key → hashCode() → hash function → gets compressed into array index.

If two keys hash to same index → collision occurs.

#### Step 3: Collision Handling

When multiple keys map to the same index → it forms a linked list inside that bucket.

Example: keys 2, 18, 34 may all hash to bucket 2.



#### Step 4: Java 8 Optimization (Linked List → Balanced Tree)

In Java 8, if a bucket's linked list grows too long (threshold = 8 entries),
it converts the linked list into a balanced tree (Red-Black Tree).

Why? Because searching in a long linked list is O(n), but in a balanced tree, it becomes O(log n) — much faster for worst cases.



#### Step 5: Put and Get Operations

Both .put() and .get() first compute the hash and then go to the correct bucket (array index).

Inside the bucket:
- If only one item → direct match.
- If multiple (collision) → it traverses linked list or tree to find the key.

#### Complete Internal Flow of HashMap

```
Key → hashCode() → hash → index (hash & (capacity - 1)) →
  → Go to bucket[index]:
     - If no collision → store node
     - If collision:
         - If entries ≤ 8 → use linked list
         - If entries > 8 → convert to balanced tree (Java 8+)
```

### Practical Example: Using HashMap in Two Sum

Let's trace through our Two Sum solution to see how the HashMap works:

For the input array `[2, 7, 11, 15]` with target `9`:

1. i=0: nums[0]=2
   - complement = 9-2 = 7
   - map is empty, so add {2→0} to map
   - map: {2→0}

2. i=1: nums[1]=7
   - complement = 9-7 = 2
   - map contains 2!
   - return [map.get(2), 1] which is [0, 1]

This demonstrates the efficiency of using HashMap for lookups - we found our answer in just 2 steps!
