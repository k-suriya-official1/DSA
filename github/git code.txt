✅ 1. Clone your GitHub Repo (only first time)
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/k-suriya-official1/DSA.git
cd DSA
✅ 2. Create Day Folder and Add File
bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir Day1_Two_Sum
➡️ Save your Java file (e.g., TwoSumBruteForce.java) inside Day1_Two_Sum folder.

✅ 3. Stage, Commit, and Push
bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Day 1: Added Two Sum brute force solution inside Day1_Two_Sum folder"
git push -u origin main
✅ 4. Next Day Repeat ➡️ Day 2, Day 3...
bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir Day2_ProblemName
# (Save your file inside new folder)

git add .
git commit -m "Day 2: Added ProblemName solution"
git push
✅ Branch Check (Optional)
bash
Copy
Edit
git branch
➡️ Make sure you are on main branch, not master.

Now you will always:

Keep each day's problem in separate folders (Day1, Day2, Day3…)

Push everything to the same main branch correctly.
